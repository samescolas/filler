# filler

The goal of this project is to build a simple bot to play a game called filler, facilitated by the filler_vm 
executable with the hopes of beating the other players.

## To play:

To run the game ./resources/filler_vm -p1 (INSERT PLAYER1 HERE) -p2 (INSERT PLAYER2 HERE) -f (MAP)

Maps are located in .resources/maps, players are located in ./resources/players.

Makefile compiles to the same player as ./resources/me.
